The provided snippet demonstrates **an inline function or expression-bodied function**. This style is common in programming languages like **C#** and **JavaScript** (with slight modifications) and is known as:

### **Expression-Bodied Member** (C# Example)
In C#, this syntax is an example of an **expression-bodied method**, introduced in **C# 6.0** for simplicity in writing single-line methods or properties.

### Key Characteristics:
1. **Return Type:** `int` – The function explicitly specifies the type of value it returns.
2. **Parameters:** `(int x, int y)` – Two integer parameters `x` and `y`.
3. **Arrow Function:** `=>` – The lambda-style arrow defines the body of the function.
4. **Expression:** `x + y + 1` – The single expression evaluates and returns a result.

### Correct Syntax in Context:
```csharp
int Add(int x, int y) => x + y + 1;
```

### Behavior:
When called with two integers as arguments, the method returns their sum, incremented by 1.
